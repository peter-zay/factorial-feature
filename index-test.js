FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT
Factorial Feature
In this project, you will use test-driven development to build a factorial method. You will use the assert module and mocha testing library to drive your development using tests that follow the phases: setup, exercise, and verification.

How To Calculate Factorial
You take an integer and you multiply that by all the integers that are less than it.

The factorial of an integer n is denoted by an exclamation mark n!, so 5! is equal to:

 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

Edge Case
An edge case is a problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating parameter — you can think of these as special cases that you need to account for. Based on the logic of factorials, you would expect that calculating 0! would look like this:

0 × 0 = 0

But mathematically this is not true. In this instance of a factorial method, there is an edge-case which is that 0 factorial (or 0!) is 1.

The steps below follow the red-green-refactor cycle and will guide you through the process of using test-driven development to create a factorial method. The factorial method will be inside an object named Calculate. You will be implementing your test code in the file index_test.js, and your implementation code in index.js.

After you complete each step, run the test suite in the terminal to test the results.

If you get stuck during this project, check out the project walkthrough video which can be found at the bottom of the page after the final step of the project.

Tasks
11/11 complete
Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
Factorial Feature With TDD
1.
Get into the red part 1a:

In your index_test.js file, add an it statement, and then fill in the error message to state that it will test if the output of 5! is equal to 120.

Structure for an it statement:

  it('...', () => {
                                                        
  });

2.
Get into the red part 1b:

Follow the steps below to write a test that checks if 120 is equal to Calculate.factorial(5).

Write an assert.equal() statement inside your it block
The first argument in your assert.equal() statement should be Calculate.factorial(5)
The second argument should be 120
Remember to run npm test to see the error message.

3.
** Get into the green part 1:**

In your index.js file, add a factorial method inside the Calculate object
The factorial method should accept one input and return 120
The expected outcome of 5! is 120

4.
Refactor part 1

In your index_test.js file, refactor your test code so that it follows the first three phases of a good test.

Setup
Exercise
Verify
Make descriptive variables to represent your input and expected output value
Ex. inputNumber or expectedResult
Make a descriptive variable to represent the outcome of .factorial(inputNumber)
Write an assert.equal() statement that compares your expected and actual outcomes
5.
** Get into the red part 2:**

Write another test, with an input other than 5 to put yourself back in the red. This will force you to write implementation code that covers more conditions than just .factorial(5).

You can write a test that checks if your factorial method returns 6 when you pass 3 to .factorial()
6.
Get into the green part 2:

In your index.js file, replace the line of code return 120 with code that will actually calculate the factorial of the input argument passed to the .factorial() method.

The code block you could use to calculate the factorial of a number is:

for (let i = inputNumber - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
  inputNumber = inputNumber * i; 
}

return inputNumber

7.
Refactor part 2

If you haven’t already done so, make sure that all your test code uses descriptive variables instead of actual numeric values, and make sure that it follows the first three phases of a good test.

Refactor your implementation code so that it is more concise and efficient. This could include cleaning up the existing code, or using a built-in method instead of a for loop for calculating the factorial of any input.

8.
Edge case: test code part 1

In your index_test.js file, write an empty it block with an error message that covers the 0! edge case.

9.
Edge case — production code

In your index.js file add implementation code that makes your edge case test pass.

The structure of a conditional statement looks like this:

if (/he input number is 0/) { 
  //  then return 1
}

10.
Edge case: test code part 2

Finish writing your edge-case test using
